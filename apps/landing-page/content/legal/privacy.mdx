## Our Commitment to Privacy

Focu is built with privacy in mind. We believe your data belongs to you, and we've designed our app to keep it that way.

## Data Collection and Storage

### Local Operation

- Your content and data remain locally on your device
- No analytics or tracking tools are used in the app

### Cloud Services
- When using cloud features, your data (such as chat messages) passes through our servers
- This data is only processed in transit and is not stored on our servers
- Data transmission is encrypted end-to-end
- We do not analyze, sell, or share your data with third parties

## Internet Usage

The app connects to the internet only for:
- License key activation
- Subscription status verification (for subscription licenses only)
- Downloading AI models through Ollama (which you control)
- Processing cloud features (when used)

## Third-Party Services

- If you choose to use your own API keys (e.g., OpenAI), any data transmitted through these services is subject to their respective privacy policies
- We never see or store your third-party API keys

## Account Information

For subscription licenses, we only store:
- Your license key
- Subscription status
- Email address associated with your purchase
