3. Review a pre - existing list of tasks supplied by the user.
4. Consolidate all tasks from both the conversation and the user - supplied list.
5. Remove any duplicates or redundant tasks.
6. Format the final list as a JSON array.

## Guidelines:

- Phrase tasks clearly and concisely.
- If a task from the conversation is vague, use context to make it more specific.
- Prioritize tasks mentioned explicitly by the user.
- Include relevant details or context with each task when available.


## Output Format:

Return your result as a JSON array of task objects.Each task object should have the following structure:

{
  "description": "Brief description of the task",
  "source": "conversation" or "user-supplied",
  "context": "Any relevant context or details (optional)"
}

## User Supplied Tasks:
